# Quiz 8 - Imaging and Coding Technique Exploration

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

### Inspiration: *Soul* (2020)

In Pixar's *Soul* (2020), the depiction of the souls in *The Great Before*, the realm where unborn souls prepare to come to the earth (as shown in the screenshots below). The slightly gradient color and the translucent forms of the souls move in smooth, continuous flows have created a sense of weightlessness and ethereal presence. The way these forms an beautiful example of fluid motion in digital art had inspired me to explore more of this aspect applying what I learned in this unit. The artistic geometry shapes, lines and different layers of colors in a flow of motions evoke a sense of dynamic transformation, generating more engaged and visualised scenes for audiences when incorprating this part to my final project.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

### Coding Technique: Perlin Noise and Color Interpolation in p5.js

To achieve the fluid, artistic movement in *Soul*, one possible technique is to incorporate **Perlin Noise** in p5.js. Perlin noise creates smooth, continuous motion, making it helpful for simulating the flowing movements of the souls. When combined with **Color Interpolation**, it allows for seamless transitions in color, producing soft, non-repeating patterns that feel natural. Blending these effects—smooth movement with subtle color shifts and fading—recreates the abstract, dream-like quality that mirrors the fluid, cloud-like visuals in the movie. The combination evokes the surreal and emotional atmosphere reminiscent of *Soul*.

#### Example Code:
