# Quiz 8 - Imaging and Coding Technique Exploration

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

### Inspiration: *Soul* (2020)

In Pixar's *Soul* (2020), the depiction of the souls in "The Great Before" is a prime example of fluid motion in digital art. The abstract, translucent forms of the souls move in smooth, continuous flows, creating a sense of weightlessness and ethereal presence. The way these forms morph and interact through glowing transitions and soft curves is inspiring for this project. I'd like to incorporate this technique into my animation to evoke a sense of dynamic transformation, using fluidity to visually communicate the flow of energy or emotion.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

### Coding Technique: Particle Systems with Perlin Noise in p5.js

To emulate the fluid, organic movement from *Soul*, I plan to use a **particle system** in p5.js. By implementing Perlin noise, I can create smooth, continuous movement for the particles, which will help mimic the flow of the souls. Perlin noise generates natural, non-repeating patterns that work well for fluid, cloud-like motion. Combining this with color gradients and fading effects, I aim to create flowing transitions similar to those in the movie.

#### Example Code:  
You can find an example implementation of a particle system using Perlin noise in p5.js [here](https://editor.p5js.org/username/sketches/abcd1234).
